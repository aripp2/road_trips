		<h2>My Love for Traveling</h2>

		<p>Growing up in a military family we moved and traveled a lot. My fondest memories are of some of the amazing road trips we took. The most memorable was when we moved from Virginia to Alaska during the summer of 1993. We had an RV and took an entire month to zigzag our way across America and Canada, visiting family and friends along the way. Our travels took us through a total of 15 US States and 2 Canadian Providences. I was nine years old at the time and my best friend on this journey was my six year old brother.</p>

		<p>Now as a mother myself, I have shared this passion with my three children. We have been on several road trips over the years, and many more to come. I want to share with you about the most recent trip we took. It was last summer, in June of 2018. We had a week to travel from Colorado to the Oregon Coast. Our week was filled with tons of fun and adventure!</p>

		<h2>Our Favorite Stop</h2>

		<p>As you can probably imagine, it isn't easy to pick a <q>favorite</q> place when everywhere we went was amazing. That being said, we all agreed that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flaming_Gorge_Reservoir" target="_blank">Flaming Gorge Reservoir</a> (opens in new window) was the highlight of our trip. It is the only place we stayed for more than one night, and it was absolutely worth it. This wasn't my first time visiting this magical place, but it was the first time I was able to take my kids.</p>

		<p>Most of the Flaming Gorge Recreation area is in Wyoming, but we camped at Mustang Ridge Campground which is located in the Utah. There are 43 campgrounds to pick from, but in my opinion Mustang Ridge is the best. Each night is only $25 and it is one of the few that has showers available. As valuable as it is to be able to shower on a road trip, there is another reason we always chose this spot... CLIFF JUMPING!!!</p>

		<p>All of my kids have inherited one of my other passions, water. Our campsite was a short hike to the inviting waters of the reservoir. The particular section of the 360 miles of coast line we are able to access offers one of the most ideal spots to cliff jump. There are a variety of different heights to pick from depending on your preference and skill level. Most of our jumps were off 5-10ft cliffs. I am proud to share that my youngest and I both braved the approximately 25ft jump! Riley was just shy of 10 years old at the time. When you watch the video you will see he unexpectedly attempted to incorporate a front flip. Despite having a sore back and lack of desire to repeat the attempt, he was stoked to have do it.</p>

		<p class="last">Riley was not the only one to experience jumping into the beautiful water, my daughters Raelyn(13) and Rebekah(11) did as well. They also spent hours exploring, hanging out on their floaties and we even built a fire to roast marshmallows for a snack before heading back to our campsite. Back at camp we also enjoyed a few games of mountain croquet, cairn building, and relaxing in the hammocks. The girls and I even slept in the hammocks one night.</p>
